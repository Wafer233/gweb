# Preface

## Before gweb
This .md file is writing to myself. ^^

Hello Wafer, when you do a project, have you ever come up with an idea, why you use the specific famework? 

For example, when you do the graduation projcet in your B.E course, your target is to make an application of computer vision, have your ever think of why you use Pytorch, not TF, not others?

At least when I am writing this .md file, the answer is NO.

So as I finish a monolithic project webook, and trying to find a **Reinventing The Wheel** project to finish my CV, I find this open-source project and first time come to think of this problem - why there are so many framwork/ package.

For go web, you have used a framework gin. And why no the stdlib (net/http). The answer is in the following words.

在设计一个框架之前，我们需要回答框架核心为我们解决了什么问题。只有理解了这一点，才能想明白我们需要在框架中实现什么功能。
